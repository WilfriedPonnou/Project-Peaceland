Preliminary questions

1)What technical/business constraints should the data storage component of theprogram 
architecture meet to fulfill the requirement described by the customer inparagraph «Statistics»?
So what kind of component(s) (listed in the lecture) will the architecture need?

The customer wants to save the data for later statistics, therefore, you need to save the data indefinitely. 
We also know that the sum of  all daily report weights is 200Go. 
So we conclude that  data storage needs to be a data lake as it can store  data permanently and is suitable for storing large amounts of data. 
Furthermore, from a financial point of view, using a data lake is interesting, by using cloud data lakes for example.

2)What business constraint should the architecture meet to fulfill the requirement describe in the 
paragraph «Alert»? Which component to choose?



3)What mistake(s) from Peaceland can explain the failed attempt?



4)Peaceland has likely forgotten some technical information in the report sent by the drone. 
In the future, this information could help Peaceland make its peacewatchers much more efficient. Which information?
